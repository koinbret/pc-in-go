Python Challenge in Go. Because why not?
========

Once upon a time Python Challenge taught me a lot about Python, I'll be surprised if it doesn't teach me anything  about Go as well.

Some levels are Python dependent. In such case I'll try to solve a non-Python-specific version of the level, or some other task that teaches a similar thing. For example in level 5 a simple conversion from pickle to JSON makes the challenge solvable in Go w/o affecting the task itself in any way.

This is a learning experiment. I'm exploring Go and its standard library. Nothing more, nothing less.
If you want to judge my skills by looking at this code you're wasting your time :-) I've written literally 0 bytes of Go code before starting this.
